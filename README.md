Colliner Pattern Recognition
============================

Collinear Pattern Recognition assignment for my Data Structures class.


This is my code for a Collinear Pattern Recognition assignment for my Data Structures class.
I was supposed to write three classes: A Point class, a Brute class, and a Fast class.
The Point class' purpose is obvious enough, it's a data type to store the coordinates and help with sorting.
The Brute class is a very ham-handed at pattern recognition, every point is checked against every other point not already checked.
The Fast class is a much smarter: It selects a point and then sorts all the other points according to their angle to the selected point
then it searches for four or more points with the same angle and says that's a line. Then it doe this again and again until all points are used up.
