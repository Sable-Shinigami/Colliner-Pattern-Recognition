 * This is my code for a Collinear Pattern Recognition assignment for my Data Structures class.
 * I was supposed to write three classes: A Point class, a Brute class, and a Fast class.
 * The Point class' purpose is obvious enough, it's a data type to store the coordinates and help with sorting.
 * The Brute class is a very ham-handed at pattern recognition, every point is checked against every other point not already checked.
 * The Fast class is a much smarter: It selects a point and then sorts all the other points according to their angle to the selected point
 * then it searches for four or more points with the same angle and says that's a line. Then it doe this again and again until all points are used up.
